# Care-2-Share

[Care-2-Share](https://flask-dutch-life-project.herokuapp.com/welcome) website is representative of the community where I live. On my walks through our neighbourhood I have often come accross casual displays of generosity. It is not strange to find a table on the front lawn of a property, displaying fruits, vegetables, eggs, plant seedlings, honey, home made jams, second hand books, childrens' toys. The offerings vary. Sometimes just a few products, sometimes a lot.  There would be a sign that says help yourself, sometimes it may indicate you can take what you need and leave a small fee if you wish. Even though the random offerings are quite wonderful to come accross, not all streets are busy, the weather can ruin a splendid gesture... and off course the birds may get into the fruits...
I have seen people make random posts on social media inviting strangers to contact them if they feel alone and would like to join for a family dinner. In winter I have often seen posts about soups being made, to share.  I have seen a couple invite strangers to make use of their large garden for picnics or barbeques.  
I have been in this country for three years and admit that even though the pandemic basically halted the sense of community for about two years, people seem eager to once again engage with their fellow human beings. It is not just about the people being approachable, my new countrymen and women do not like letting anything go to waste. I have read that the Netherlands is a circular economy (in process off course), but it is very apparent from my perspective.  Wearing previously loved clothes is fashionable.  Bicycles are being passed on (and I am not referring to the ones being taken without permission....).  
Developing this website brought me great joy and I would love to get it ready to share with the community.  I would definitely be an active participant.  I have made my share of petfood donations (my cats insist they want a varied diet, and once I buy enough to last a while they change their minds and we end up with tins, pouches and bags of catfood that I know could be well enjoyed by other, less fussy felines in our neighbourhood).
In my opinion I now live in a community that can appreciate diversity and enjoy some of the simple joys life can offer, like sharing rather than letting those extra eggs or apples go to waste.
This website is a tool that the community can use to ensure those products are shared, before the "best before" time runs out. (even then it may still not go to the waste bin !)  Care-2-Share can enable like minded people to connect and as a result this website came to fruition, yes sharing is caring. 
The site enables members from the community to register as an online member, browse what is on offer, add their own offerings to the list, amend and delete their offers when required. When new members sign up, they need to provide their postal code to confirm they are from the area.  It is not a security layer but more an informal manner for keeping it within the community. At this stage this is still a manual check being attended to by the site owner, with the intention to change the code to only allow new members to sign up should their postal codes correspond with specific parameters (for the area).  Visitors may also contact the admin (site owner) by sending an email.  

For the community the value of the site is an easy to use platform to do what they have been doing, for the site owner it is pure enjoyment of finding the like minded sharing and caring attitude of other community members aiming to not let any peasoup or "oliebollen" go to waste.

The website is not area specific and can very easily be adapted / applied for other areas / communities, if desired.

- all pages should clearly indicate all the clickable links in the navigation bar, on all types of devices
- the home page should provide basic information and be clear about the purpose of the website
- the registration page is where a member can register to enable them to have a profile on the website, which will grant them access to the offers page and enable them to post their own offerings, amending and / or deleting same. Said page will require a username, firstname, surname, postal code and password to be inserted.
- disclaimer, rules and guidelines at the bottom of the registration page are just a few basic rules / guidelines which new members are required to read when signing up, and reading same needs to be confirmed by clicking the check box which will enable their registration to be complete
- in an attemt to keep the website a friendly environment for all (prior to making the site available for the public, consulation with a law practitioner will be required to ensure that the disclaimer meets the needs of the site owner and is in accordance with the governing laws, further consideration of good conduct rules may be considered, prior to providing a feature where the members may be enabled to upload images, privacy laws need to be considered and further guidelines in regards thereto may need to be reflected on the site.)
- the login page will enable a registered member to access their profile by inserting their username and password and thus gaining access to their profile and all available offers

- contact admin page is where the site owner provides contact details to the public and no registration is required to visit said page.  Registered members and/or the public will be allowed to contact the site ownwer, should they require assistance, have queries, suggestions, complaints, concerns, compliments, etc.

Possible future release:
- depending on the outcome of legal consultation and depending whether required / requested by the members of the site, the site owner will consider enabling members to upload photographs of their offerings, however said photographs will have to be authorised by the site owner before appearing on the site to ensure suitability such as privacy laws etc where not breached.
- FAQ: frequently asked questions page may be considered and developed, based upon community interaction via the email form.


### Structure

The purpose of the website is to bring members of the community together by enabling them to easily share with one another, whether it be a meal, a barbeque event or childrens' toys.  The website is structured for absolute ease of use by new and existing members.  The site has a logical and easy flow, ensuring a positive user experience.  The structure was developed with that in mind.
- The initial website consists of:
    -   Welcome page - available to the public and giving basic information about the website
    -   Login page - to enable registered members to log into the website which will allow access to their own profile page, the all offers page and new offers page
    -   Register page - for new/unregistered members to be able to register and thus get access to all the content of the website. For registration they need to create a username
        provide their firstname, surname and postal code, create their own password and confirm that they agree to abide by the rules as set out on the bottom of the
        registration page by clicking the checkbox provided (a requirement before registration can take place)
    -   Contact Admin page - provides both registered members and unregistered users access to obtain contact details of the site administrator, such as a contact number, email 
        address, office address and available hours
    -   Profile page - reflects the registered user's username, firstname, surname, postal code and password. The registered user can change their password on this page, should they
        want / need to at any stage after their initial registration.
    -   All Offers page -  this page has the option for the registered and logged in user to see all the available offers, to filter the offers by category, to filter the page to 
        only see the offers of the registered user, to clear the filters and to edit or delete their own offers.  Registered members do not have the option to delete or edit offers of other members. No edit or delete buttons appear on the offers of other members.
    -   New Offers page - once a registered member is logged in, they can add their own offer which will appear on the All Offers page.  To add an offer, a member must first elect a 
        category from the drop down list, thereafter provide an offer name, then a description of the offer, provide a collection address, collection date and there is an option to reflect the collection start time and expiry time. A member can also indicate whether the offering is a hot or a cold product, which may be relevant for any persons considering collection of said offering.
    -   Logout in the nav bar - by clicking on the Log Out tab in the navigation bar a registered user is easily logged out of their profile and the registered section of the site.

### Surface

- The clickable logo and navigation bar is consistently located on each page, allowing an intuitive user experience
- The images shown on the site, reflects the Katwijk community, which images in itself will draw the community members in as they would be curious about the happenings in their  
  direct environment
- The layout has been kept very clean and simple as the site is aimed at absolutely all persons within the Katwijk community, young and old, from all backgrounds
- The colours taken from the Materialize Color Palette was also kept very simple and more shades of the same colors were used in stead of a greater variety of colours, also to keep
    the site looking calm and relaxing.  The colours were also chosen reflect the blue skye, green of the trees and the colours of the incredible blue and green building.

        "Cool colors include green, blue, and purple, are often more subdued than warm colors. They are the colors of night, of water, of nature, and are usually calming, relaxing, and somewhat reserved.

        Blue is the only primary color within the cool spectrum, which means the other colors are created by combining blue with a warm color (yellow for green and red for purple).

        Because of this, green takes on some of the attributes of yellow, and purple takes on some of the attributes of red. Use cool colors in your designs to give a sense of calm or professionalism." Taken from (https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/color-theory-for-designers-part-1-the-meaning-of-color/)
